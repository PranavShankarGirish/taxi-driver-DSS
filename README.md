## Taxi Driver Decision Support System using Finite Horizon Formulations

This project proposes a data-driven project focused on optimizing the decision-making process for taxi drivers by leveraging historical ride data. Currently, taxi drivers rely on manual, case-by-case decision-making when deciding whether to accept or decline a trip. This approach leaves drivers susceptible to suboptimal choices, as they lack a comprehensive understanding of the potential profitability of each trip. Further, the algorithms currently in place in ride-hailing apps only consider optimizing overall trips, without granularity to optimize the earnings of individual drivers. The key objective is thus to develop an optimization model that guides taxi drivers in determining whether to accept or decline a trip based on potential returns for the day, considering factors such as distance, time of day, prices, and historical earnings
